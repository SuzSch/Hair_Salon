#### By Suzanne Schuber

## Technologies Used

* ASP.NET Core MVC
* Entity Framework Core
* C# 
* MySQL Database
* HTML
* CSS
* Git
* Razor Views

## In this application you are able to add a list of stylists working at the salon, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists have specific specialties, so each client can only see (belong to) a single stylist. As the salon owner you can: 
* See a list of all stylists.
* Select a stylist, see their details, and see a list of all clients that belong to that stylist.
* Add new stylists to the system when they are hired.
* Add new clients to a specific stylist.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's root directory called "HairSalon.Solutions".
